## Prompt 14 â€“ Developer Documentation and Architecture Guide

```
You are GPT-5 Codex. Goal: make onboarding new contributors easier.

Tasks:
1. Write `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` explaining high-level modules (Capture, Imaging, Review, Storage, Monetization) and data flow between them.
2. Add `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` outlining coding standards, testing expectations, and how to run the app without hardware (using mocks/fakes).
3. Generate a diagram (ASCII or Mermaid) depicting the imaging pipeline stages and where configuration settings feed in.
4. Update `README.md` to reference the new docs and include a quick-start checklist.

Validation:
- Ensure Markdown passes basic lint (if tooling exists) or is at least well-formatted.
- Link the new docs from appropriate locations in the repo.
