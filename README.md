## Algorithms

### Grid Detection

The app uses platform-optimized computer vision for hemocytometer grid detection:

#### iOS Implementation (Apple Vision)
1. **Vision Framework**: VNDetectRectanglesRequest for robust rectangle detection
2. **Focus Assessment**: Laplacian variance for image sharpness
3. **Glare Detection**: HSV analysis for overexposed regions
4. **Perspective Correction**: Core Image CIFilter.perspectiveCorrection

#### Android Implementation (OpenCV)
1. **Preprocessing**: Convert to grayscale, apply CLAHE enhancement
2. **Edge Detection**: Canny edge detection to find grid lines
3. **Line Detection**: Hough transform to identify dominant orientations
4. **Corner Finding**: Intersection of perpendicular line sets
5. **Validation**: Geometric constraints and aspect ratio checks

```typescript
// Cross-platform grid detection pipeline
const result = await cvNativeAdapter.detectGridAndCorners(imageUri);
if (result.gridType && result.corners.length === 4) {
  // Proceed with perspective correction
  const correctedUri = await cvNativeAdapter.perspectiveCorrect(imageUri, result.corners);
}
```

### Cell Segmentation

Cross-platform segmentation pipeline with ML acceleration:

#### iOS Implementation
1. **Core ML UNet**: 256x256 neural network segmentation (when available)
2. **Fallback Pipeline**: OpenCV classical segmentation if Core ML unavailable
3. **Metal Acceleration**: GPU-accelerated processing via Vision framework

#### Android Implementation  
1. **Background Subtraction**: Gaussian blur background estimation
2. **Adaptive Thresholding**: Local threshold adaptation
3. **Morphological Operations**: Opening to remove noise
4. **Watershed Splitting**: Separate touching cells
5. **TensorFlow Lite**: Optional ML refinement
6. **Contour Analysis**: Size and circularity filtering

```typescript
const segmentationResult = await segmentCells(
  correctedImageUri,
  processingParams,
  pixelsPerMicron
);

// Platform-specific backend selection happens automatically
// iOS: Core ML → OpenCV fallback
// Android: OpenCV → TensorFlow Lite (optional)
```

### Viability Classification

Color-based classification using HSV analysis:

```typescript
function classifyTrypanBlueViability(colorStats: ColorStats): ViabilityResult {
  const { hue, saturation, value } = colorStats;
  
  // Dead cells appear blue (high hue, saturation)
  const isInBlueRange = hue >= 200 && hue <= 260;
  const hasHighSaturation = saturation >= 0.3;
  const hasLowValue = value <= 0.7;
  
  const isDead = isInBlueRange && hasHighSaturation && hasLowValue;
  
  return {
    isLive: !isDead,
    confidence: calculateConfidence(colorStats),
    reason: isDead ? 'Blue staining detected' : 'Live cell'
  };
}
```

### Counting Rules

Implements standard hemocytometer inclusion rules:

```typescript
function applyInclusionRule(detections: DetectionObject[], squareIndex: number): DetectionObject[] {
  return detections.filter(detection => {
    const { x, y } = detection.centroid;
    
    // Include top and left borders, exclude bottom and right
    return x >= left && x < right && y >= top && y < bottom;
  });
}
```

### Concentration Calculation

Standard hemocytometer formula implementation:

```
Concentration (cells/mL) = Average cells per square × 10⁴ × Dilution factor
Viability (%) = (Live cells / Total cells) × 100
```

## Configuration

### Processing Parameters

Adjust segmentation sensitivity in Settings:

- **Block Size**: Adaptive threshold neighborhood (31-101, odd numbers)
- **Threshold Constant (C)**: Offset from mean (-10 to 10)
- **Min/Max Cell Area**: Size filtering in μm² (50-5000)
- **Use Watershed**: Enable touching cell separation
- **TensorFlow Lite Refinement**: ML-based segmentation improvement

### Viability Thresholds

Customize color classification:

- **Hue Range**: Blue color detection (200-260°)
- **Saturation Minimum**: Dead cell saturation threshold (0.3)
- **Value Maximum**: Dead cell brightness threshold (0.7)

### Quality Control

Set quality thresholds:

- **Min Focus Score**: Laplacian variance threshold (100)
- **Max Glare Ratio**: Percentage of overexposed pixels (0.1)
- **Cell Density Limits**: Min/max cells per square (10-300)
- **Variance Threshold**: MAD-based outlier detection (2.5)

## Data Export

### CSV Format

The app exports data in multiple CSV formats:

1. **Summary CSV**: One row per sample with key metrics
2. **Square Counts CSV**: Per-square statistics
3. **Detections CSV**: Individual cell data (optional)

Example summary CSV:
```csv
Sample ID,Timestamp,Operator,Concentration (cells/mL),Viability (%),Live Cells,Dead Cells
sample_001,2024-01-15T10:30:00Z,Dr. Smith,2.5e6,85.2,170,30
```

## Testing

### iOS (SwiftUI) Tests

The active codebase is a native SwiftUI app. You can run tests via Xcode or the command line after generating the project with XcodeGen.

1) Generate the Xcode project (if needed):

```bash
brew install xcodegen
xcodegen generate
```

2) Open in Xcode and run tests (recommended):

- Open `SmartCellCounter.xcodeproj`
- Select the `SmartCellCounter` scheme
- Press Command-U to run all tests

3) Or run from command line (requires Xcode + simulators):

```bash
xcodebuild \
  -project SmartCellCounter.xcodeproj \
  -scheme SmartCellCounter \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14' \
  test
```

Notes:
- Unit tests live under `SmartCellCounterTests/` and validate observable state and utilities.
- UI tests live under `SmartCellCounterUITests/` and launch the app to verify basic flows.

### Archived React Native Tests

The previous React Native implementation is archived under `archive/rn/`. If you need to run its tests, use the commands below within `archive/rn/`:

```bash
# In archive/rn/
yarn install
yarn test
```

## Performance

### Optimization Targets

- **End-to-end processing**: < 3 seconds for 1080p images
- **Memory usage**: < 200MB during processing
- **Battery efficiency**: Optimized for mobile devices
- **Offline capability**: No internet connection required

### Performance Monitoring

The app includes built-in performance logging:

```typescript
import { logger } from '@/utils/logger';

// Automatic timing for async operations
const result = await logger.timeOperation('segmentation', async () => {
  return await segmentCells(imageUri, params);
});

// View performance statistics
const stats = logger.getPerformanceStats('segmentation');
console.log(`Average duration: ${stats.averageDuration}ms`);
```

## Deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Camera not working:**
- Ensure camera permissions are granted
- Test on physical device (camera doesn't work in simulator)
- Check for proper lighting conditions

**Grid detection fails:**
- Improve image focus and lighting
- Clean hemocytometer surface
- Use manual corner adjustment mode

**Poor cell detection:**
- Verify sample preparation and staining
- Adjust processing parameters in Settings
- Check cell density (avoid overcrowding)

**Export failures:**
- Ensure sufficient device storage
- Check file permissions
- Verify sharing app is installed

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging in development:
