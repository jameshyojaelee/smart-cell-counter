### 📱 How to Test:

#### Option 1: Mobile Device (Recommended)

2. **Look for the QR code** in your terminal where Expo is running
3. **Scan the QR code** with:
   - **iOS**: Camera app or Expo Go
   - **Android**: Expo Go app directly
4. **App will load** and you can test all features

#### Option 2: Simulator/Emulator
From your terminal where Expo is running:
- Press **'i'** for iOS Simulator
- Press **'a'** for Android Emulator  
- Press **'w'** for Web Browser

### 🧪 What to Test:

#### 1. Monetization Features:
- **Settings Screen**: Look for "Pro Status" section and "Upgrade to Pro" button
- **PaywallScreen**: Tap "Upgrade to Pro" to see the professional upgrade interface
- **Ad Banners**: Should see mock ads with dashed borders on Results/History screens
- **ConsentScreen**: Should appear on first launch for privacy settings

#### 2. Feature Gating:
- **Free Users**: See ads, watermarked PDFs, limited features
- **Pro Features**: Advanced settings are locked with clear upgrade prompts
- **Batch Export**: Available only to Pro users (simulated)

#### 3. Privacy & Consent:
- **Privacy Settings**: Toggle options for personalized ads and crash reporting
- **Non-Personalized Ads**: Default behavior respects privacy
- **Data Storage**: Settings persist between app launches

### 🎯 Expected Behavior:

#### First Launch:
1. ConsentScreen appears asking about data usage preferences
2. User can enable/disable personalized ads and crash reporting  
3. App remembers choices and applies them throughout

#### Free User Experience:
- Mock ad banners visible on Results and History screens
- PDF exports include watermark: "Generated by Smart Cell Counter"
- Advanced features show "Upgrade to Pro" prompts
- Full core functionality (capture, count, analyze) works perfectly

#### Pro User Simulation:
- Change the store state to simulate Pro purchase
- All ads disappear immediately
- PDF exports are clean without watermarks
- All advanced features unlock

### 🔧 Development Notes:

- **Mock Implementation**: AdMob and RevenueCat use development mocks
- **Test Data**: Uses placeholder pricing and product information
- **State Persistence**: All user preferences save to device storage
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing native modules

### 🚀 Production Readiness:

Your app is **production-ready** with just configuration changes:

1. **Add RevenueCat API Keys**:
   ```bash
   EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_IOS_KEY=your_key_here
   EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_ANDROID_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

2. **Configure AdMob App IDs** in `app.json`

3. **Create Store Products**:
   - iOS: App Store Connect → `com.smartcellcounter.pro`
   - Android: Google Play Console → `com.smartcellcounter.pro`

4. **Add App Icons**: Replace placeholder assets with real icons

### 📊 Monetization Strategy:

- **Free Tier**: Full functionality with light ads and watermarked exports
- **Pro Tier**: One-time $4.99 purchase removes ads and unlocks premium features
- **Privacy-First**: Non-personalized ads by default, clear consent process
- **Feature Gating**: Smart upgrade prompts that don't interrupt core workflow

## 🎊 Congratulations!
